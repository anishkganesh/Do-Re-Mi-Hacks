# Do-Re-Mi-Hacks


## Inspiration

We were inspired by the struggles or artists and musicians worldwide so we took it on us to empower them and give them opportunities to get out there and perform live or do live 'gigs' as the are also called. We thought of creating a platform like a website to allow for providers to find artists for performances so that artists can earn and also advance their careers.

## What it does

Our platform connects musicians to providers. Providers choose musicians based on choices such as type of music, can they dance, how many members(band, duo or solo). Then they are connected and the fee is generated based on our code which estimates the rate and fees. It then gives us a small cut and then most of it goes for the musician.

## How we built it

We build the UI part with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. For the UI part, we used the neumorphism UI CSS framework with Bootstrap CSS. We also used the Jquery and other jquery based libraries for achieving the desired output. For the backend, we used flask and made a REST-API based system. We connected all the routes and wrote the business logic in flask. We created a home page, a role-based login logout system for companies wanting to hire musicians and musicians who want to get hired. We created a musician search page and company jobs search page. We made seperate profile pages for musicians and companies.

## Challenges we ran into

Creating the whole site from scratch was very difficult in such a small amount of time. Even integrating the backend flask application with the front end part was a bit difficult.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of

We integrated the Neumorphism UI for the frontend.
Integrated UI using the flask microframework Created routes to respective pages Created a relational backend database that links users to events

## What we learned

We learned more things about flask and its different features, integration of it and also AI. We learned using Flask to integrate backend and frontend and also learned to use CSS frameworks for doing things faster. We also learned to create a role-based login logout system.

## What's next for GigFinder

Next would be to get providers and musicians on the platform and create a huge network allowing us to increase and empower more artists through this platform.
